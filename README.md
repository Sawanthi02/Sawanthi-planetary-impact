# Planetary Impact: A ND developer assignment

Hi! If you are reading this you might be interested in doing an internship at New Designers. Great! At New Designers a lot of the work developers do will be to convert Figma designs into a real website or app. So that's what this assignment is about. You are to implement a one page website, whose design will be provided to you.


### Task details

You will be setting up the project yourself, using the most recent version of **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS** and **Typescript**. This is the tech stack we work with at New Designers. 


### Resources

The [figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/bXhdPm0KfCiqrzg4e9ZV82/PlanaryImpact-design?node-id=2-94&m=dev&t=p1zB6lWMDKIRz2br-1) contains the designs, both desktop and mobile.


The images that are used in the figma can be found in this repo, in the `public/images` folder.

### Your assignment

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Set up a project in the repo folder using Next.js using Tailwind CSS and Typescript.
3. Translate the figma design to a live website to the best of your abilities. Ensure the site is responsive and works on all modern browsers. Test your work thoroughly
4. Write clean, maintainable code and pay attention to detail. We won't give you more specific details because we want _you_ to impress us.


### Deliverables

1. Commit your work and push the commits to your forked GitHub repository.
2. Deploy the site to Netlify.
3. Provide us with the URL of your forked GitHub repository and your Netlify deployment

Good luck! We're excited to see what you come up with!
